#+TITLE: My fork of julia-repl

This is my fork, mainly to use comint and add additional utilities to
send code blocks.


* TODO-List

** TODO Look up symbol
- LanguageServer.jl https://github.com/julia-vscode/LanguageServer.jl
- non-Jedi's comment on using eglot: https://github.com/julia-vscode/LanguageServer.jl/wiki/Emacs
- M-. issue in julia-repl https://github.com/tpapp/julia-repl/issues/50
- lsp-julia https://github.com/non-Jedi/lsp-julia

** TODO Doc
The default doc works fine, =C-c C-d= will send =@doc xxx= to the
repl. The only problem is that the fill paragraph does not seem to
work correctly.  For example, =@doc reshape=.

** TODO viewing images in repl
